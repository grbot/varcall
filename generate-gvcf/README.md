# Intro

The Nextflow script run HaplotypeCaller on BAMs/CRAMs.

Please see `nextflow.conf` for GATK version and references databases used.

## Sample sheet format

Below is the sample sheet format. The sample sheet should be a tab delimmted text file and should be specified in `nextflow.config`.  For the HaplotypeCaller run, SampleID, Gender and BAM/CRAM columns are required.

- Gender column should contain M for male and F for Female.
- BAM column should contain the flll path to the BAM.
- All collumns not used in this step (Fastq1R1, FastqR2, gVCF) should be filled in with a "."


| SampleID | Gender | FastqR1 | FastqR2 | BAM/CRAM | gVCF |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | --- | ---- |
| A01      | F      | .       | .       | /pathto/A01.bam | . |


## To run

For each dataset
1) Create your sample sheet. E.g. `NA12878.samplesheet.txt` for the NA12878 dataset.
2) Modify your `nextflow.config` to read the `NA12878.samplesheet.tsv` and specify the output directory e.g. `out_dir = "/spaces/gerrit/projects/adme/datasets/sahgp/nextflow-out"`. Also please set the type of sequencing protocol e.g. wes and wgs are currently supported. For wes the target_regions parameter needs to be set to a path, for wqs the parameter can be set to empty.
3) Run the workflow
```
nextflow -log nextflow.log run -w /spaces/gerrit/projects/adme/datasets/NA12878/nextflow-work -c nextflow.config main.nf -profile wits -with-report NA12878.report.html -with-trace -with-timeline NA12878.timeline.html -resume
```

## Output

The output directory will contain per sample directories. Each sample directory will contain

1. `sample_id.[1-22].g.vcf.gz` files
1. `sample_id.MT.g.vcf.gz`
1. If
   1. Female samples, a `sample_id.X.g.vcf.gz`
   1. Male samples, a  `sample_id.X_PAR1.g.vcf.gz,sample_id.X_PAR2.g.vcf.gz,sample_id.X_nonPAR.g.vcf.gz,sample_id.Y_PAR1.g.vcf.gz,sample_id.Y_nonPAR.g.vcf.gz`
1. A `sample_id.g.vcf.gz` that is a combined, sorted and indexed file of the files above.  Would be easiest to use this file for downstream processing.
